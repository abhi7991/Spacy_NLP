This code uses spacys entity ruler to tag words from media clippings/published reports.
I am trying to find all "NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS"/"DEALS" over the last 4 years 

Some of the pre-requisites is
1. Installing spacy
2. Pandas
3. numpys
4. requests
5. unidecode ( for cleaning data)

**Any other additional packages can be removed
